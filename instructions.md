### Drive & Migration

If you want to enable the Markdown service to manage 
markdown files, configure a disk drive in `config/drive.ts` and supply its
name in `config/markdown.ts`.

This feature will also leverage the markdown_files migration, which is
defined in `database/migrations/1669132699150_markdown_files.ts`. This migration
assumes the existence of a `users` table, and should be renamed if necessary
to run after the users migrations.

If you do not intend to use this feature, delete the migration file 
and don't configure a disk drive.
